# Hallelujah for the Cross

---

Up to the hill of Calvary  
My Savior went courageously  
And there he bled and died for me  
Hallelujah for the cross

---

And on that day the world was changed  
A final perfect lamb was slain  
Let earth and heaven now proclaim  
Hallelujah for the cross

---

Hallelujah for the war He fought  
Love has won death has lost  
Hallelujah for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

What good I've done could never save  
My debt too great for deeds to pay  
But God my Savior made a way  
Hallelujah for the cross  

---

A slave to sin my life was bound  
But all my chains fell to the ground  
When Jesus' blood came flowing down  
Hallelujah for the cross

---

Hallelujah for the war He fought  
Love has won death has lost  
Hallelujah for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross

---

And when I breathe my final breath  
I'll have no need to fear that rest  
This hope will guide me into death  
Hallelujah for the cross

---

Hallelujah for the war He fought  
Love has won death has lost  
Hallelujah for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross

---

Hallelujah for the war He fought  
Love has won death has lost  
Hallelujah for the souls He bought  
Hallelujah for the cross  
Hallelujah for the cross  
Hallelujah for the cross

#Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
In the dawning of the king  
He the theme of heaven's praises  
Robed in frail humanity

---

In our longing, in our darkness  
Now the light of life has come  
Look to Christ, who condescended  
Took on flesh to ransom us

---

### but [Christ] emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Phil 2:7-8

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
He the perfect Son of Man  
In his living, in his suffering  
Neither trace nor stain of sin

---

See the true and better Adam  
Come to save the hell-bound man  
Christ the great and sure fulfillment   
Of the law; in Him we stand

---

### For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Heb 4:15

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Christ the Lord upon the tree  
In the stead of ruined sinners  
Hangs the Lamb in victory

---

See the price of our redemption  
See the Father's plan unfold  
Bringing many sons to glory  
Grace unmeasured, love untold

---

### He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. 1 Pet 2:24

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Slain by death the God of life  
But no grave could e'er restrain Him  
Praise the Lord; He is alive!

---

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope  
Christ in power resurrected  
As we will be when he comes

---

### But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. 1 Cor 15:20

---

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope  
Christ in power resurrected   
As we will be when he comes

# Resurrection Hymn

---

See, what the morning, gloriously bright,  
With the dawning of hope in Jerusalem;  
Folded the graveclothes, tomb filled with light,  
As the angels announce Christ is risen!  

---

See God’s salvation plan, wrought in love,  
Borne in pain, paid in sacrifice,  
Fulfilled in Christ, the Man, for He lives:  
Christ is risen from the dead!   

---

See Mary weeping, “Where is He laid?”  
As in sorrow she turns from the empty tomb;  
Hears a voice speaking, calling her name;  
It’s the Master, the Lord raised to life again!  

---

The voice that spans the years, speaking life,  
Stirring hope, bringing peace to us,  
Will sound ’til He appears, for He lives,  
Christ is risen from the dead!  

---

One with the Father, Ancient of Days,  
Through the Spirit who clothes faith with certainty,  
Honor and blessing, glory and praise  
To the King crowned with power and authority.  

---

And we are raised with Him, death is dead,  
Love was won, Christ has conquered.  
And we shall reign with Him, for He lives,  
Christ is risen from the dead!

---

And we are raised with Him, death is dead,  
Love was won, Christ has conquered.  
And we shall reign with Him, for He lives,  
Christ is risen from the dead!

# In Christ Alone

---

In Christ alone my hope is found,   
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This Cornerstone, this solid ground,   
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

---

What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease  
My Comforter, my All in All,   
Here in the love of Christ I stand

---

In Christ alone, who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  

---

'Till on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live

---

There in the ground His body lay   
Light of the world by darkness slain   
Then bursting forth in glorious Day   
Up from the grave He rose again 

---

And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Brought with the precious blood of Christ

---

On Christ, the solid Rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand;  
All other ground is sinking sand.   
On Christ, the solid Rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand;  
All other ground is sinking sand. 

---

No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny

---

No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
'Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand
