#Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
In the dawning of the king  
He the theme of heaven's praises  
Robed in frail humanity

---

In our longing, in our darkness  
Now the light of life has come  
Look to Christ, who condescended  
Took on flesh to ransom us

---

### but [Christ] emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Phil 2:7-8

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
He the perfect Son of Man  
In his living, in his suffering  
Neither trace nor stain of sin

---

See the true and better Adam  
Come to save the hell-bound man  
Christ the great and sure fulfillment   
Of the law; in Him we stand

---

### For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Heb 4:15

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Christ the Lord upon the tree  
In the stead of ruined sinners  
Hangs the Lamb in victory

---

See the price of our redemption  
See the Father's plan unfold  
Bringing many sons to glory  
Grace unmeasured, love untold

---

### He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. 1 Pet 2:24

---

Come behold the wondrous mystery  
Slain by death the God of life  
But no grave could e'er restrain Him  
Praise the Lord; He is alive!

---

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope  
Christ in power resurrected  
As we will be when he comes

---

### But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. 1 Cor 15:20

---

What a foretaste of deliverance  
How unwavering our hope  
Christ in power resurrected   
As we will be when he comes
