# Be Thou My Vision

---

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

---

Be Thou my wisdom, Thou my true word
I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father and I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

---

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

---

O God be my everything, be my delight
Be Jesus my glory, my soul satisfied (2x)

---

High King of heaven, my victâ€™ry won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

---

O God be my everything, be my delight
Be Jesus my glory, my soul satisfied (2x)

---

Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
